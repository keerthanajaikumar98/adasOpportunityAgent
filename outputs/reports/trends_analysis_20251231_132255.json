      "name": "4D Imaging Radar Transition",
      "description": "Traditional radar systems only measure distance, speed, and angle. New 4D imaging radar adds height detection and creates detailed 3D maps of surroundings, similar to how lidar works but using radio waves instead of laser light. This enables better object classification and works in all weather conditions.",
